    "kangenSolution": {
      "title": "How Kangen's Ionization Technology Helps",
      "content": "Kangen Water® machines first filter your tap water to reduce common impurities. Then, through a process called electrolysis, the water is ionized, altering its pH and Oxidation-Reduction Potential (ORP). This process aims to produce water that is cleaner and potentially offers antioxidant properties. While not a cure for any disease, Kangen Water® is designed to provide a high-quality drinking water option."
